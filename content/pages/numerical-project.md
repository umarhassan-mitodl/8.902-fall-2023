As noted in the syllabus, the final project for the course will be released on session 21 and due on session 28. For the project, students will work in groups of around 3 to run a cosmological simulation using the Gadget-4 code, which is a state-of-the-art cosmological code used in the field of galaxy formation simulations. Students will then analyze the output by examining the resulting dark matter density and writing their own halo finder code. The final product will be a presentation during the second-to-last class of the semester, approximately 15 minutes long, depending on the number of groups.
