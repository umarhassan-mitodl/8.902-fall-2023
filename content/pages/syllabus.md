## Course Description

This course broadly covers galactic dynamics and large scale structure in the universe. Major topics include galaxies, cosmology, structure formation, cosmic microwave background, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and thermal history of the universe. Specific topics within these groups include the following:

- Galactic dynamics: potential theory, orbits, collisionless Boltzmann equation, etc.
- Galaxy interactions
- Groups and clusters: dark matter 
- Intergalactic medium: x-ray clusters
- Active galactic nuclei: unified models, black hole accretion, radio and optical jets, etc.
- Homogeneity and isotropy, redshift, galaxy distance ladder
- Newtonian cosmology
- Robertson-Walker models and cosmography
- Early universe, primordial nucleosynthesis, recombination
- Cosmic microwave background radiation
- Large-scale structure, galaxy formation

## Assignments

There are 7 problem sets, including the midterm assignment, which will contribute evenly to the final grade. Problem sets with computational components are assigned two weeks in advance of their due date, and those without are assigned 1–1.5 weeks in advance (depending on where holidays fall). Contact the course TA for extensions or if you have questions or concerns about the assignments and grades.

## Numerical Project

The final project for the course will be released on session 21 and due on session 28. For the project, students will work in groups of around 3 to run a cosmological simulation using the Gadget-4 code, which is a state-of-the-art cosmological code used in the field of galaxy formation simulations. Students will then analyze the output by examining the resulting dark matter density and writing their own halo finder code. The final product will be a presentation during the second-to-last class of the semester, approximately 15 minutes long, depending on the number of groups.

## Grading

The breakdown for the final grade is as follows:      

- Problem sets: 50%       
- Project: 30%       
- Final exam: 20%
